        <h1>Background</h1>
        <P>The story of Tshidi's Kitchen is baked in the warmth of a bustling home in Polokwane, Limpopo. For Tshidi Mabasa, the eldest of six children, her family's kitchen was the heart of a noisy, loving, and often chaotic universe. With her parents separated, much of the responsibility for helping to feed her three sisters and two brothers fell onto her young shoulders.

It was in this kitchen that Tshidi learned to stretch a single chicken into a hearty stew for eight, to make the softest magwinya (vetkoek) to fill hungry stomachs after school, and to perfect her father’s favourite fiery chakalaka. Cooking wasn't just a chore; it was her way of caring for her family, her way of creating comfort and a sense of unity amidst challenging times. The flavours of her kitchen—smoky, spicy, and deeply hearty—became the flavour of love and resilience.

After finishing school, Tshidi took a job as a receptionist, but her passion always simmered on the back burner. She noticed that the pre-made sauces and relishes on supermarket shelves couldn't compare to the vibrant, authentic tastes of her home cooking. She dreamed of sharing the soulful food of Limpopo with others.

Her big break came when she entered a local food festival's amateur competition. Using her Gogo’s recipe for a unique Marula & Pepper sauce, a flavour inspired by the Limpopo landscape, she won first prize. The requests from strangers asking, "Where can we buy this?" gave her the courage to start.

She began small, cooking large batches of her sauces and chakalakas in her home kitchen after work, with her siblings acting as her first taste-testers and packaging team. They sold them at church bazaars and local taxi ranks. Word spread quickly through Polokwane about "that young lady with the magic sauce." The demand grew from a trickle to a flood.

Driven by her family's belief in her, Tshidi took a leap of faith, registered her business, and with the help of a small youth entrepreneurship grant, secured a humble commercial kitchen unit. Tshidi's Kitchen was officially born in 2019. Her entire family rallied behind her; her brothers managed deliveries, and her sisters helped with labelling and sales. It was a true family affair.

Today, Tshidi's Kitchen products are stocked in stores across the province and are growing nationally. But the heart of the business remains the same: to offer the same comfort, love, and hearty nourishment she gave her family to every customer, turning every meal into a gathering.</P>
